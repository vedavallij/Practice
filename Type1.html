    <q> Where Words Fail, Music Speaks...</q>
    <p> Music always had an impact among people but now it has become the only way of communication among youngsters. Mainly because youngsters<br>are more <u>introverted and stay indoors</u>, they tend feel that the music is written for them.<br>All they love about it is the vibe even when 
        there is no one is around  </p>
